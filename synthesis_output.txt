3-LS3-1  Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits

3-LS3-1: Students who demonstrate understanding can: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited from parents and that variation of these traits exists in a group of similar organisms. [Clarification Statement:  Patterns are the similarities and differences in traits shared between offspring and their parents, or among siblings. Emphasis is on organisms other than humans.] [ Assessment Boundary:  Assessment does not include genetic mechanisms of inheritance and prediction of traits. Assessment is limited to non-human examples. ]
